Hello, everyone 🤚🏻!

This is a project based on Meta AI's Hateful Meme detection challenge. <br>
The goal is to correctly classify memes that are offensive from those that are not. 

To do this, I built a neural network <img src='https://www.onlygfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/brain-clipart.png' width="20"> that can take in images, text and knowledge extracted from a meme.

<h2> Images 🖼 </h2>
The first step is to extract knowledge from the image.<br>
<br>
The visual and textual knowledge extraction part can be found in the tutorial file in the repo. <br>
ImageAI system to recognise objects in the image.<br>
DeepFace system to recognise faces in the image.<br>
Image Captioning system to describe what is in the image.<br>

<h2> Knowledge 🌍 </h2>
I created a system for extracting knowledge from the text of a meme using wikidata. 

<h2> Graph-Based System 🚀 </h2>
The graph-based system architecture is as shown in the image.
